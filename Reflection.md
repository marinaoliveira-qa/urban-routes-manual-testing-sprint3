# Sprint 3 Reflection

During this sprint, I strengthened my ability to:
- Validate UI and business logic together
- Identify input validation defects
- Structure clear and reproducible test cases
- Execute test scenarios using defined preconditions
- Think critically about user flows and edge cases

This project reinforced the importance of validating both functionality and user experience in reservation-based systems.

# Skills Demonstrated
- Manual test case writing
- Checklist-based validation
- Business logic testing
- Defect identification and documentation
- Structured sprint execution
- Clear QA reporting
