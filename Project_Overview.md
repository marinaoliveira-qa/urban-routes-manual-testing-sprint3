# Project Overview

This repository contains manual test documentation and execution results for Sprint 3 of the Urban Routes web application.

Urban Routes is an educational ride reservation platform used during my QA Bootcamp to apply real-world testing concepts in a structured sprint environment.  
Sprint 3 focused on validating the reservation workflow, payment method functionality, and the business logic behind the “Reserve” button.  
All testing was performed manually.

# Project Context

This project was completed as part of a QA Bootcamp training program in a sprint-based workflow.  
Urban Routes was used to practice:
- Writing structured test cases
- Creating functional checklists
- Validating UI and business logic
- Executing positive and negative test scenarios
- Logging defects in Jira

Sprint 3 specifically targeted the reservation flow and payment validation logic.
